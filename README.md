Additional Considerations
Authentication State: Manage authentication state in React using Context API or Redux, and handle token storage securely.

API Endpoint URLs: Ensure that your frontend API calls are pointing to the correct backend URL.

File Uploads: Handle file uploads on the backend and integrate a storage solution (e.g., Amazon S3) for podcast audio files.

Error Handling: Implement proper error handling in both your frontend and backend to provide a smooth user experience.

Security: Secure your application by validating inputs, protecting routes, and managing sessions appropriately.

Deployment: Deploy your application using services like Heroku (backend) and Netlify or Vercel (frontend).
